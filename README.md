# Finance App - Backend
This is the backend repository for my personal Finance App, built using Java and Spring Boot. 
The backend is designed to handle core financial functionalities such as transaction tracking, budgeting, user management, and integration with Kafka for asynchronous event processing.

The application follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with features including:

JWT-based authentication and authorization

RESTful APIs for secure client interaction

PostgreSQL (or your DB) as the persistent data store

Kafka integration for messaging (e.g., email notifications or transaction logs)

Entity-DTO mapping using MapStruct

Docker support for containerized deployment

This repository serves as the core engine powering the finance appâ€™s backend logic, and is built with scalability, maintainability, and clean architecture in mind.
