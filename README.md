# Finance App - Backend
Originally started as a coding template to teach and reinforce backend fundamentals, this project gradually evolved into a full backend stack powering a real-world finance management application.

The backend is responsible for handling core financial functionalities such as transaction tracking, budgeting, user management, and Kafka-based asynchronous messaging. It follows a modular and service-oriented architecture with clean code practices.

Key Features:
✅ JWT-based authentication and authorization

📊 RESTful APIs for managing users, transactions, budgets, etc.

🐘 PostgreSQL as the persistent data store

📦 Kafka integration for event-driven communication (e.g., sending emails or logging activities)

🔁 Entity-to-DTO mapping using MapStruct

🐳 Docker support for containerized deployment

🧪 Unit-tested service layer for reliability

This repository reflects a complete backend solution designed with scalability, maintainability, and teaching in mind.
